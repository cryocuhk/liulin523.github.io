# Openings 

## PhD positions
Our group takes one or two new PhD students every year. Students in our group came from various educational backgrounds (geology, geomatics, math, physics, remote sensing, solid-earth geophysics, etc). Students with strong mathematics and physics background and programming skills are desirable. If you are interested in pursuing PhD degree in our group, please send an [email](mailto:liulin@cuhk.edu.hk). State what and why you are interested and attach a CV.

**For fall 2019:** we are looking for one student with geology/geophysics backgrounds to work on a research project on present-day tectonic and non-tectonic movements near the southern edge of the Qiangtang block on the Tibet Plateau.

Please refer to our [postgraduate programme webpage](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/pg_prg.html) for [admission requirements](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/pg_prg.html#require), [procedures](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/pg_prg.html#procedure), and [deadlines](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/pg_prg.html#period).

You are highly suggested to apply for the prestigious **Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme**. The application deadline is 1 December every year. Please refer to [this website](http://www.rgc.edu.hk/hkphd) for further details of the Scheme. 

Every summer, we host a **workshop** inviting all potential applicants to our campus. The first batch of PhD offers are made shortly after the workshop. Application is open in Spring.  See this [webpage](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/sw2018.html) for the one held recently.
