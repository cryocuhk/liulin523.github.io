# Research

## Current Projects
**Kinematics and Dynamics of Periglacial Landforms in China**

Yan Hu, PhD student

Yan is currently working on mapping permafrost landforms in western China, such as rock glaciers, protalus lobes, solifluction sheets etc, and quantifying their kinematic characteristics in order to understand their variations and potential response and impact in the context of global climate change. Her research is based on remote sensing especially InSAR technique and in-situ geological and geophysical investigations. 

Watch this 1-min video to get a glimpse of her recent work:

Our collaborators include Professors Lin Zhao and Tonghua Wu (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Professor Tobias Bolch and Dr. Philipp Rastern (University of Zurich), and Dr. Xiaowen Wang (University of Tokyo).

This research is funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Project CUHK14303417).

Yan is supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](http://www.rgc.edu.hk/hkphd).


**Thermokarst landforms on the Tibetan Plateau**

Lingcao Huang, PhD student

Lingcao's research focuses on the distribution of thermokarst landforms, including thaw slumps (above figure) and thermal erosion gullies, on the Tibetan Plateau and the factors affecting it. In many permafrost areas, warming and thawing of ground result in distinct thermokarst landforms in remote and isolated regions. He applies image processing methods, including deep learning algorithm, to multi-source remote sensing data, aiming to map these landforms automatically. He also analyzes the spatial-temporal changes of the mapped landform and investigate the driving factors of their evolution by integrating other data such as digital elevation model and meteorological data.

This research is funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Project CUHK14300815).

**GNSS Reflectometry and its applications in Cryosphere**

Jiahua Zhang, PhD student

Jiahua is working on using the GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) to measure and quantify the changes of ground surface physical properties, such as surface elevation, snow depth, and surface soil moisture, in permafrost terrain, to understand the dynamics of the active layer and the uppermost permafrost, the interactions between them and the atmosphere, and their response to the climate variations.

This research is funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council.



**Terminus variations of Greenland glaciers**

Enze Zhang, PhD student
Enze’s research focuses on terminus variations of glaciers in Greenland, quantifying such variations in a high temporal resolution and understanding their controlling factors. Based on deep learning, he develops a method to extract the calving front automatically using multi-sensor remote sensing imagery (TerraSAR-X, Sentinel1, Landsat). He also analyzes the controlling factors of the calving front variations by combining other data such as glacier velocity and bed elevation.
