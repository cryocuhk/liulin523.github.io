## Current Projects
**Kinematics and Dynamics of Periglacial Landforms in China**

Yan Hu is currently working on mapping permafrost landforms in western China, such as rock glaciers, protalus lobes, solifluction sheets etc, and quantifying their kinematic characteristics in order to understand their variations and potential response and impact in the context of global climate change. Her research is based on remote sensing especially InSAR technique and in-situ geological and geophysical investigations.
