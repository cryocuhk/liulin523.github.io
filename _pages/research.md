## Current Projects
**Kinematics and Dynamics of Periglacial Landforms in China**

Yan Hu, PhD student

Yan is currently working on mapping permafrost landforms in western China, such as rock glaciers, protalus lobes, solifluction sheets etc, and quantifying their kinematic characteristics in order to understand their variations and potential response and impact in the context of global climate change. Her research is based on remote sensing especially InSAR technique and in-situ geological and geophysical investigations. 

Check out this short video to get a glimps of her recent work:

Our collaborators include Professors Lin Zhao and Tonghua Wu (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Professor Tobia Bolch and Dr. Philipp Rastern (University of Zurich), and Dr. Xiaowen Wang (University of Tokyo).

This research is funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council.

Yan is supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](http://www.rgc.edu.hk/hkphd).
